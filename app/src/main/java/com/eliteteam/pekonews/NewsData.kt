        "It's been a spotty couple of years for PC gaming. Don't get me wrong, we've had plenty of great games to play and talk about, but there's no ignoring the big holes the Covid-19 pandemic has punched into the usual routine. Any optimism or curiosity during reveal streams this year was dogged by the worry that no matter what games were announced or how great they looked, they'd be years away, million-dollar logos ripped straight from the pitch doc. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "But while this year of delays has been a bummer, it has also primed 2022 to be one of the best years in PC gaming ever.\n" +
                "In 2022 we're getting new games from beloved studios, sequels to all-time PC classics, and the indie scene is growing more incalculably large and surprising than ever. Every genre that's been declared dead at some point is gonna be alive and well in 2022, a big slate of live service games will still be kicking ass, the PC will have multiple Crysis-tier graphics pushers, and games will be more affordable and accessible than ever. And now Valve's putting out a damn portable computer at a low price. \n" +
                "\n" +

                "2019's Sekiro was an excellent action game, but it's been five years since FromSoftware's last proper RPG. Elden Ring is finally coming, delivering with a mythos built by George R.R. Martin, FromSoftware's biggest world yet, and some major added depth to character progression. This isn't just the culmination of FromSoftware's signature RPG and dungeon design, but the natural progression of a heritage of dungeon-crawling on PC, from Rogue to Ultima Underworld and now, hopefully, Elden Ring. \n",
        "“Let’s play a game,” is a phrase that brings smiles to so many faces. Games are a fundamental way that humans interact and learn. They provide so many benefits for people of all interests and abilities.  Children especially love playing games and these activities provide such a great opportunity for them to practice so many skills. In Thrive’s Child Advancement Program (CAP), a mentoring program, the mentor and mentee pairs engage in many worthwhile games and receive so many benefits out of these interactions.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The Thrive offices in the Bozeman Public Schools are filled with various board games, card games, and even art supplies to make your own games. Because games can be such a great icebreaker, CAP Coordinators often suggest that mentors and mentees start off their relationship by playing games as a way to get to know each other. Games “can teach important social skills such as communicating verbally, sharing, waiting, taking turns, and enjoying interacting with others.”1 Board games especially can assist with the ability to focus and lengthen attention spans “by encouraging the completion of an exciting enjoyable game.”(1)  \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Do you have a child that is competitive and doesn’t like to lose? The CAP Program deals with that a lot.  The way to work on those behaviors is to keep playing games! CAP Coordinators advises mentors to push through and coach the child on how to handle disappointment in games.  Playing by the game rules also helps children by providing boundaries and for the m to know how far they can push their opponent and the directions. And you do not have to let the child win! Always allowing a child to win does not give them the opportunity to work on skills necessary for life. They are not always going to win at everything in life – and that’s okay. Kids can start learning this notion as early as parents and caregivers allow them, and playing games is a simple and effective way to demonstrate this life skill.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Playing games is important for adults too! Games for adults are a fun way for the adult to fuel their “imagination, creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional well-being.”(2)  It was also found in the British Medical Journal that playing games, particularly board games, is a “relevant way to preserve cognition and to prevent cognitive decline or dementia.”3 It also added that “other stimulating leisure activities like reading, traveling, gardening, doing odd jobs or playing sports do not offer the same advantages and ease of practice”(3) as games.   The CAP Coordinators find this true as they have talked to many mentors who have enjoyed learning new games with their mentees and relay that they learn new ideas all the time and feel like their time is so good for their overall well being and did not expect that benefit!\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Games are a fun way to enhance many aspects of your life. So the next time that you hear, “Let’s play a game!” be ready to jump in and PLAY!\n" +

        "fortnite is ‘good’ in the first place is because it’s free. But there’s this other game called Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG for short) if you are a gamer you definitely heard of this game before. Just like fortnite PUBG is a Battle Royale game where people fight against each other in a big map to be the last man standing. So people claim that fortnite is better because it’s free, but in fact there are a lot of things that PUBG does better than fortnite. First, PUBG has better graphics than fortnite, a lot of gamers prefer the realistic world of PUBG rather than the cartoonish graphics of fortnite. Second, the maps of PUBG is way larger than fortnite’s so the battle will be more intense. There’s also vehicles that lets you and your squad to travel together through the map. Third, PUBG let’s you toggle between first and third person mode, unlike fortnite which limits your view to third person. it’s just good to have this feature so you get to choose your desired view.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "So to sum up, PUBG offers a much better experience than fortnite. So a lot of gamers are willing to spend a bit more for a better gaming experience. With everyone playing PUBG, people will start to quit fortnite.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Furthermore, there’s this game that’s coming in October, and that’s Call of Duty Black Ops 4, you’ve probably heard of call of duty before, and this call of duty will be a whole new FPS experience because of the brand new blackout mode. It’s just like PUBG and fortnite where you fight against each other and try to claim the title of the last man standing. So it’s a brand new Battle Royale game. Ever since gamers are really hyped for it. So hyped that even some fortnite players are quitting fortnite and looking forward to COD.\n" +

                "as for why minecraft is better, I would say that minecraft has much more stuff to play with compared to fortnite. You can play the most classic minecraft survival, collect materials and survive from the monsters that come out at night. You can build whatever you can think of in creative mode. you can download maps to play, and even play with friends in servers. The most popular minecraft server is hypixel. On the server there are tons of awesome mini games like bedwars where you defend your own bed and try to destroy other people’s beds. It skywars where you are on different islands, you have to collect weapons and items to fight against others to be the last man standing. (Pretty much battle Royale like PUBG and fortnite).\n" +

        "PUBG is the best mobile game due to many reasons. I would like to write as many reasons as I find.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "NEW GAME MODE PUBG brought into the gaming market the concept of Battle Royale one of the first time ( However It is arguable as games like H1Z1 etc. were first of the games that featured Battle Royale But PUBG popularised it ). As the old saying goes, Things which are seen are the things which are sold.\n" +
                "TIMING PUBG came into the market when more and more of people were buying phones and PC's. One more thing fortunate for PUBG was the launch of JIO. PUBG soon understood that the gaming market in India mainly comprises of Mobile games. And they made their mobile game before any one of the other Battle Royale games. (This is also a conflicting statement as games like FREEFIRE were launched before it but as I said before It popularised it).\n" +
                "ADVERTISEMENTS PUBG was first of the mobile games to advertise it on TV and youtube. Thus more and more people came to know the game.\n" +
                "Now If you are asking why PUBG is superior than other games then It is great because of following\n" +
                "\n" +
                "GRAPHICS The graphics of the game are top-notch. Such type of graphics are not easily available on mobile games.\n" +
                "MINIMALISM The PUBG game is very minimal. Easy to understand. Game can be started within some few clicks.\n" +
                "MULTIPLAYER The PUBG game supports multiplayer. We know we always loved social websites apps so why not games. PUBG connects us with gamers all around the globe. And we can also talk to them through voice chat.\n" +
                "ESPORTS PUBG also organises esports which are huge source of income for gamers.\n" +

        "Among Us is one of the most popular socially driven video games around. Since it can be easily streamed for an audience, the game exploded when content creators started to play it together.\n" +
                "As is often the case when games start to be played by influencers, certain phrases and terminology are brought to the forefront. And with Among Us, “sus” is perhaps the most associated word.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sus doesn’t have any sort of special meaning in and of itself. It is simply an abbreviation of the word “suspicious.” \n" +
                "Because players are given a short period of time to discuss with one another in between rounds where they are required to perform tasks, cutting the word “suspicious” down from three syllables to just one has some inherent value when players are trying to figure out who in their group is the imposter.\n" +
                "Naturally, the phrase “sus” has started to leak into other areas of the internet and is an abbreviation that is used in regular conversations outside of Among Us. If you happen to hear the phrase outside of an Among Us game, whoever is using it is probably also using it as an abbreviation for the word “suspicious.”",

                "\n" +

                "While most trash talking is just meant to throw other players off their game, taking this type of talk personally can cause harm. Some kids begin to take what they are hearing to heart. Comments such as \"you suck\", \"you're the worst gamer\" and \"no one likes to play with you\" can run deep for a child. \n" +

                "\n" +
                "* Think positive thoughts - instead of focusing on trash-talking, help your child to come up with positive thoughts that they can call on when the trash talk begins. For example, encourage them to focus on the fun, or focus on beating a level. Have them think about their gaming strategy or think about something that they are good at. This will divert their attention from the trash talk and keep them focused on the game.\u2028\n" +
                "* Don't take the bait - We all know that when someone is trying to bully you, they are trying to get a reaction out of you. So, help your child to understand that they shouldn't take the bait. That doesn't mean that they should sit in silence, but they shouldn't engage with the trash-talking comments. \u2028\n" +
                "* Another good technique is to laugh along with the trash-talker. Instead of letting them get a rise out of you, join in with them and agree with their comments about you or laugh along with them. This is likely to deflate them!\u2028\n" +
                "* Lastly, if your child won't lose out by not talking during the game, then you can always tell your child to unplug and play without listening. Sometimes that is the best line of defence as your child learns other strategies that they are comfortable with. \u2028\n" +

        "Do you ever wonder what’s lurking in your tap water? It turns out what you don’t know can hurt you. Each municipality has its own water treatment process, but there’s a good chance the water that comes from your faucet harbors a certain level of contaminants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a minimum standard of water quality, which allows pollutants to remain in the water that makes it to public water systems as long as it doesn’t exceed the set amount.

For example, as of 2018, Rhode Island ranked first in urban air quality and drinking water quality, while Maine ranked last. For many states settled in between, tap water is deemed undrinkable regardless of its minimally-met conditions.

                "￼\n" +
                "50 Cent: Blood in the Sand is a third person shooter game developed by Swordfish Studios. Playing the game in easy mode and failing is like a curse.\n" +
                "The developers constantly reminds you how bad are you at playing the game by rewarding a ‘Non Bulletproof’ achievement. This achievement was prominently displayed everywhere so everyone knew how much of a wuss you actually were at playing the game. Not cool thing to do.\n",
        "There’s nothing like flipping on your favorite video game after a long day at school. 60 percent of Americans play video games daily. But while it may seem like a benign method of relaxation, playing video games has significant effects on your behavior. A wealth of recent scientific evidence shows that playing video games too often, especially ones with gratuitous violence, can cause serious psychological problems.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Playing video games causes your brain to release dopamine. Dopamine is important for learning and concentration, but it is also the same chemical released when people do drugs like cocaine. If you spend too much time playing video games you could develop a gaming disorder.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The World Health Organization defines a gaming disorder as “a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In other words, if you can’t stop playing League of Legends because you’re stressed about finals you might have a problem. The best thing to do is put the game down and study. If you make a habit of avoidance, the problems you ignore will pile up and consume you.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A comprehensive study from the Journal of Health Psychology shows that gaming disorders are linked to greater levels of loneliness, anxiety, depression, sleeping problems, social problems and many other psychological-social problems.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If you suffer from any of these problems, you are not helpless. Negative emotion is how your brain makes you aware that something’s off. If you ignore the problems at the root of your malaise, they only get worse.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For example, while it’s true that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance there are many steps you can take to fix this without having to take pharmaceuticals. An analysis of dietary patterns and depression risk shows that a diet of fruits, vegetables, fish, low-fat dairy and other healthy foods decreases the risk of depression. Exercise and sleep patterns are also linked to a healthy chemical balance in the brain.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sedentary behavior, such as playing video games excessively, increases your risk for health problems. These health problems exacerbate the psychological problems caused by playing video games. If you have health problems because of poor diet or exercise the best thing to do is go to the gym. It doesn’t matter what you look like—just get in there and do something. If you don’t want to go to a gym you can do push-ups, sit-ups, dips, crunches and squats without leaving the house. Just put aside at least an hour every day for exercise and you’ll notice an improvement in your mood, health and overall well-being.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Video games can also make us more aggressive. According to a report from the APA, “research demonstrates a consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions and aggression.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One study shows that areas of the frontal lobe, the region associated with decision making and cognitive function, gets deactivated after playing video games. This can also cause an increase in aggressive behavior.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Aggressive behavior is not conducive to good relationships. If you know somebody who is depressed, anxious, angry and playing a lot of video games they should probably get help. Playing more video games only pushes people deeper into the cycle of a gaming disorder.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Activating the dopamine reward system can be a good thing if done properly. Releasing dopamine reinforces behavior and allows us to learn things. An article in Psychology Today states, “Video games that are designed for progression to appropriate levels based on player mastery allow each player to participate at their individualized achievement level. This achievement level is key to motivating perseverance in academics, sports, musical instruments and other forms of learning that require effort and practice.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The energy a person spends playing video games could be better spent somewhere else. Like drugs, video games artificially increase dopamine levels in the brain without providing you with any skills. You get all the psychological rewards of winning a basketball game or learning piano without any of the real, tangible rewards.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A sense of accomplishment is something that we earn. If somebody trains themselves to dunk a basketball that means they had to spend hours jumping, running and dribbling. Practicing this skill improves their health, so this activity is psychologically and physically rewarding. You’re less likely to become obese or suffer from health problems if you spend your time developing skills that rely on physical ability.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If you want to counteract the negative effects of playing video games, try playing music. Instead of deactivating parts of the brain, music has been shown to improve cognitive function. According to another recent study, learning to play music can improve verbal memory and reading ability. Also, listening to music can improve your mood if you are depressed or anxious. So next time you feel like playing some computer game, pick up an instrument instead.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Developing skills can create a lasting sense of accomplishment. Playing video games gives you a temporary feeling of pleasure that will fade unless you keep playing. If you look down one day and realize you are overweight, it’s simply because you’ve committed yourself to a screen.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If you use video games for social interaction this could still be unhealthy. Studies show that face-to-face human interaction is more likely to reduce depression than conversations over the phone or by writing. If you have friends online, try to get together with them IRL and see what it’s like. Maybe you can play basketball or go on a hike together.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "If video games are your only source of joy and relaxation, it’s probably best if you throw them away. It isn’t that hard. Once you’ve freed your mind from the electronic screen-prison you’ll notice a significant change in your attitude, your relationships and your health. Take control of your life and push yourself to be better, stronger, smarter and happier. You can do it!",
